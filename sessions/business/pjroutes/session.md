**Done this session:**
- Built full Next.js 14 marketplace (landing, flights, booking, operator form, admin, auth)
- Supabase project `rjqwjfzvhkdkdjldlnqs` — schema run, auth OTP configured
- Vercel deployed — all 9 env vars set, build passing, live at `https://pjroutes.vercel.app`
- GitHub repo created — `github.com/jaylenmareko/pjroutes-`
- Removed SVG logo from Navbar, AuthModal, and auth page — text-only wordmark
- Fixed Resend build error (lazy initialization)
- Renamed project folder from `skyleg` to `pjroutes`
- Created CONTEXT.md

**Pending (carried forward):**
- Swap Stripe test keys → live keys before first real booking

**Focus:** End-to-end testing and feature completion.

**Confirmed working:**
- OTP auth — 8-digit codes, no magic links, from `support@pjroutes.com`
- Navbar auth state — email + dropdown (My Bookings / My Listings / List a Flight / Sign out)
- My Bookings (`/bookings`) — shows real bookings, RLS fixed
- My Listings (`/listings`) — shows operator's flights, booked flights show passenger contact info
- Booking flow end-to-end — card + ACH (PaymentElement), success page, flight disappears after booking
- Passenger confirmation email — flight details, receipt, FBO address, Stripe receipt link
- Operator notification email — passenger contact info
- Admin (`/admin`) — pending queue, Approve/Reject working
- Demo flights removed — only real DB flights show
- FBO address on operator form and in confirmation email
- Broker language removed everywhere
- PJR favicon

**Remaining:**
1. Fix operator form datetime bug — `depart_start`/`depart_end` don't update React state when set via JS; form submits empty → Supabase insert fails silently
2. Swap Stripe test → live keys in Vercel env vars
3. Enable Stripe bank transfer instruction emails — Stripe dashboard → Settings → Customer emails (manual toggle)
4. Delete test data before going live
5. Operator outreach — 402 contacts in `outreach/tier1-operators-enriched.csv`
